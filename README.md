# Runner

Runner is a simple side-scrolling platformer game. The goal is simple - don't jump too early, don't jump too late, and see how far you can get.

## History
Runner was a project I was working on in 2014, originally targeting Android. It was designed to be a simple "one-touch" control game in the same vein as Flappy Bird. I shared a few early builds with friends, but it got buried between other projects and didn't get past the early stages.

In 2019 I found that I had stored the source code on BitBucket, and decided to get a demo build of the project up and running again. With a few small tweaks, a browser-playable HTML5 build has been generated and can be played [here](http://games.chrisbarrbuilds.com/Runner/latest/).
